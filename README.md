# Alura-Geek ❤️❤️❤️
This project is a challenge designed to simulate the day-to-day life of a front-end programmer, focusing on the creation of functional interfaces and the development of problem-solving skills. It allows to consolidate key JavaScript knowledge, such as DOM manipulation, HTTP protocol handling through methods such as GET, POST and DELETE, and asynchronous programming through the use of promises. In addition, it integrates the consumption of API's and interaction with servers (json-server), providing a complete experience to practice advanced concepts and understand how the web works.
